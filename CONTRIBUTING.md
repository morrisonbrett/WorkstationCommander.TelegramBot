Contributing code and documentation changes
-------------------------------------------

If you would like to contribute a new feature or a bugfix, please discuss your idea first on a GitHub issue. If there is no existing GitHub issue for your idea, please open one. There are often a number of ways to fix a problem and it is important to find the right approach before spending time on a PR that cannot be merged. So we request you to only start the work on implementing a feature once you received a green light from one of our maintainers on your idea and its implementation.
